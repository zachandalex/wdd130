            <h3>Site Purpose with Goals</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this page is to offer guided adventures for people of all ages. It will also provide
                opportunities for people to receive training in order to go out on their own safely to explore rafting.
                The
                site will also serve as an information portal with information on equipment options and comparisons as
                well
                as a list of rafting locations and the difficulty levels of each. The site will mainly be to generate
                revenue for the Rafting America company through tour bookings and training sessions. The secondary
                purpose
                is to help users find information in order to get started rafting.</p>
